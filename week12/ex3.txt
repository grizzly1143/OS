Increasing buffer will lead to decreasing time of copying. On the other hand, decreading buffer will lead to increasing time of copying.
Adding O_SYNC parameter will lead to that I/O become synchronous and because of that its copying time will increase.
Doing the same as in 1 with O_SYNC, we will see that the time will act the same as when without O_SYNC, though the time it takes to copy will increase to greater values then before.
